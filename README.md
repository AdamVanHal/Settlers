# Settlers
A java game based on the style of Settlers of Catan     
Conosole commands to run game: 
To compile game, while in src directory type javac (asterisk)/(asterisk).java     
To run game, while in src directory after everything is compiled type java gui/LaunchWindow     
To run test suit, while in src directory after everything is compiled type java main/SettlersOfJava      
When (asterisk) is written, it is because the actual symbol will not appear in this read me, so use the actual symbol, do not literally write (asterisk).
